# Pokelife QoL UserScript

## Overview

The Pokelife QoL (Quality of Life) UserScript is designed to enhance the user experience on the Pokelife game website. It provides various improvements to the game's interface, making it more user-friendly and efficient.

## Features

- **Enhanced Pokémon Selection Screen**: Displays additional information about Pokémon, such as experience points, directly on the selection screen.
- **Market Screen Enhancements**: Adds total price display and sorting functionality to the Pokémon market screen.
- **Custom Styles**: Applies custom styles to improve the visual presentation of the game interface.

To use this UserScript, you need a browser extension that supports UserScripts, such as **Violentmonkey**, Tampermonkey, or Greasemonkey. We recommend using **Violentmonkey** for the best experience. Once you have the extension installed, follow these steps:

1. Install [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (recommended), [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/).
2. Open the [RAW file](https://github.com/Damian764/PokelifeQoL/raw/refs/heads/main/pokelife-qol/dist/pokelife-qol.user.js) in your browser.
3. Install the script using your chosen browser extension.

Alternatively, you can

1. Open the UserScript manager in your browser.
2. Create a new script and paste the contents of the `pokelife-qol.user.js` file into the editor.
3. Save the script and ensure it is enabled.
