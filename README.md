## Overview

The Pokelife QoL (Quality of Life) UserScript is designed to enhance the user experience on the Pokelife game website. It provides various improvements to the game's interface, making it more user-friendly and efficient.

2. Open the [RAW file](https://github.com/Damian764/PokelifeQoL/raw/refs/heads/main/pokelife-qol.user.js) in your browser.
3. Install the script using your chosen browser extension.

Alternatively, you can

1. Open the UserScript manager in your browser.
2. Create a new script and paste the contents of the `pokelife-qol.user.js` file into the editor.
3. Save the script and ensure it is enabled.
